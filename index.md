## What is Ubermag?

A framework to drive existing micromagnetic simulators from Python and
from within the Jupyter Notebook. Current computational backends are
OOMMF and mumax³.


## Who is behind it?

Starting with an initiative from the University of Southampton /
European XFEL GmbH by Marijan Beg, Ryan A. Pepper, and Hans Fangohr,
the mumax³ integration was started with Jeroen Mulkers and Jonathan
Leliaert from the University of Ghent in 2019.

We acknowledge additional support from Thomas Kluyver, Vanessa
Nehruji, Min RK, Gary Downing, David Cortes, Mark Vousden, and Rebecca
Carey with testing and improvements of both the software and the
webpages.

## Acknowledgements

Ubermag is a part of the Horizon 2020 European Research Infrastructure
[OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org) project (Project ID 676541).
This work was supported by the Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO-Vlaanderen) through Project No. G098917N (Jeroen Mulkers) and with a postdoctoral fellowship (Jonathan Leliaert).

## History

The project was initially called J-OOMMF (for Jupyter OOMMF). It was
renamed "Ubermag" when the mumax³ integration started.
