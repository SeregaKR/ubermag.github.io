# Ubermag

Ubermag is a framework to drive existing micromagnetic simulators from
Python and from within the Jupyter Notebook. Current computational
backends supported are OOMMF and mumax³. The project was initially
called J-OOMMF (for Jupyter OOMMF). It was renamed "Ubermag" when the
mumax³ integration started.

## Where is it and how to use it?

- How to install and how to learn using Ubermag can be found in the Ubermag [documentation](http://ubermag.readthedocs.io).

- [Try Ubermag now](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ubermag/oommfc/master?filepath=docs%2Fipynb%2Findex.ipynb) with our cloud-hosted interactive tutorials (no need to install anything on your machine).

- The source code can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ubermag)

## Support

If you need any assistance or you want to report a problem, please raise an issue in our [help repository](https://github.com/ubermag/help).

## News

As of 28 August 2019, the move from Jupyter OOMMF to Ubermag is
complete and all subpackages should be fully functioning.

## Who is behind it?

Starting with an initiative from the University of Southampton /
European XFEL GmbH by Marijan Beg, Ryan A. Pepper, and Hans Fangohr,
the mumax³ integration was started with Jeroen Mulkers and Jonathan
Leliaert from the University of Ghent in 2019.

We acknowledge additional support from Thomas Kluyver, Vanessa
Nehruji, Min RK, Gary Downing, David Cortes, Mark Vousden, and Rebecca
Carey with testing and improvements of both the software and the
webpages.
