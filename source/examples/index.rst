The notebooks shown in this section are all tailored to physical questions and
demonstrate how to solve them using Ubermag. If you are new to Ubermag
you should consider first looking at :doc:`../getting-started/index` which will
give a gentle introduction to the concepts of Ubermag. The
tutorials here try to be concise and only cover one use case. For a more
technical documentation of specific features please refer to the
:doc:`../documentation/index` and the :doc:`../api/index`.
