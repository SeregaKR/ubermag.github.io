The notebooks show in this section are all tailored to physical questions and
demonstrate how to solve them using ``Ubermag``. If you are new to ``ubermag``
you should consider first looking at :doc:`../getting-started/index` which will
give a gentle introduction into all the packages inside ``ubermag``. The
tutorials here try to be concise and only cover one use case. For a more
technical documentation of specific features please refer to the
:doc:`../package-documentation/index` and the :doc:`../api/index`.
