   notebooks/first-ubermag-simulation
   notebooks/magnetisation-field
   notebooks/energy-equation
   notebooks/dynamics-equation
   notebooks/driving-dw
   notebooks/dw-pair-conversion

.. We should think about adding an additional tutorial for:

   - ubermagtable and micromagneticdata
   - mag2exp

**Where to go next?**

There are several places where you can find more advanced documentation:

- The :doc:`../examples/index` show examples of how to solve specific physical
  questions using ``ubermag``.
- The :doc:`../documentation/index` contains explanations and examples
  of more technical functionality of the different packages, e.g. details about
  plotting or mathematical operations.
- The :doc:`../api/index` contains detailed documentation of all classes and
  functions of the different subpackages.
